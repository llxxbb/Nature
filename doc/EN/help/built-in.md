# Built-in executor

In normal case, `Executor` needs to be implemented by developers. For some commonly used general functions, Nature make it as built-in to reduce the burden on developers. For `Executor` please refer to [Executor](executor.md) and [Relation](relation.md).

As Nature's application field continues to discover, the built-in `Executor` will continue to be enriched and improved, so this document may adjust frequently.

Three types of `Executor` are defined in [Executor](executor.md): `converter`, `convert_before` and `convert_after`. The following content organized according to these three interfaces.

## converter interface

### scatter

**Function**: Split the upstream Instance into multiple downstream Instances, then use `Instance.para` to distinguish these downstream `Instance`s.

**Upstream Instance requirements**: The `Instance.content` must be in the following json format, **Note**: If the data format does not meet the requirements, you can use `convert_before` to correct it.

```json
[
  {
    "key": "a/1",
    "value": 33
  },
  {
    "key": "a/2",
    "value": 76
  },
  ...
]
```

**Downstream Instance Description**: The value corresponding to the `key` in the upstream will become the `Instance.para` of the downstream Instance, and the value corresponding to the `value` will be put into the `Instance.content` of the downstream. For example, the json above will generate the following `Instance`:

| meta           | para | content |
| -------------- | ---- | ------- |
| B:downstream:1 | a/1  | 33      |
| B:downstream:1 | a/2  | 76      |

**Options**:

| Option              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  | Default value |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| dimension_separator | If the key value of the `Instance.content` is not the separated of the `Instance.para`,   you need to set this property. For example, the key is "a-1", this attribute should be set to "-". | /             |

### merge

**Function**: merge multiple upstream data, or merge one upstream data into multiple data in downstream. **Note**: Merge can only handle **integer** data.

**Options**:

| Option    | Description                                                                                                                                                                               | Example   | Default Value |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| key       | There are three modes: Para, None and Content. See below for details                                                                                                                      | See below | None          |
| when_same | how to handle the same `key`:<br />Old: Keep the old value<br />New: Keep the new value<br />Min: Take the smallest one<br />Max: Take the largest one <br />Sum: Take the sum of the two | "Old"     | "Sum"         |
| sum_all   | whether to add the total field to the result                                                                                                                                              | true      | false         |
| top       | MaxTop(u16) reverse order topN<br />MinTop(u16) positive order topN<br />None No need for top,                                                                                            | MaxTop(5) | None          |

#### Para mode

To merge the upstream `Instance` into the downstream `Instance`, there are the following requirements:

- The `Meta` of the downstream `Instance` must be stateful so can store the merged result. Because the downstream is stateful, this mode is not suitable for use in situations with large data to merge; on the one hand, there is a problem with the capacity of the downstream itself, on the other hand, it is a performance problem for the large number of merged versions.
- The `key` of the item to be merged which comes from upstream `Instance.para`
- The `value` of the item to be merged which comes from upstream `Instance.content`

The example settings are as follows:

```json
{"key":{"Para":[0]},"sum_all":true}
```

The upstream example is as follows. According to the settings, `key` is b and `value` is 76.

| meta-string  | para | content |
| ------------ | ---- | ------- |
| B:upstream:1 | b    | 76      |

The downstream example data is as follows:

| meta-string  | content                         | state_version |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| B:sum:1\|0\| | {"detail":{"a":37},"total":100} | 1             |

The merged downstream data is as follows:

| meta-string | content                                  | state_version |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| B:sum:1\    | {"detail":{"a":37, "b":76}, "total":112} | 2             |

#### None mode

The statistical item has no key. This mode merges the upstream numeric arrays and outputs the result as the downstream `Instance`.

Examples of upstream is as follows.

| meta-string  | id  | content       |
| ------------ | --- | ------------- |
| B:upstream:1 | 123 | ["1","3","5"] |

The combined downstream data is as follows:

| meta-string | id  | content |
| ----------- | --- | ------- |
| B:sum:1     | 123 | 9       |

#### Content Mode

merge multiple upstream data, each data is [key, value] structure

Examples of option settings are as follows:

```json
{"key":"Content","when_same":"Old"}
```

The upstream example `Instance` is as follows. Note that `content` is an array of strings, and each string is an array with only two elements, the first is the `key` and the second is the `value`.

| meta-string  | id  | content                                       |
| ------------ | --- | --------------------------------------------- |
| B:upstream:1 | 123 | ["[\\"a\\":10]","[\\"b\\":2]","[\\"a\\":8] "] |

The merged downstream is as follows:

| meta-string | id  | content         |
| ----------- | --- | --------------- |
| B:old:1     | 123 | {"a":10, "b":2} |

If the value of `when_same` is changed from Old to Min or New, the value of `content` will be: {"a":8, "b":2}

## convert_before interface

### para_as_key

**Function**: Use a part of `Instance.para` as the key, and use `nstant.content` as the value to form [key, value] and replace the original `Instance.content`.

**Options**:

| Option | Description                                                   | Example | Default Value |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------- |
| plain  | If false, the value of `value` will be put in double quotes.  | true    | false         |
| part   | Which parts of the upstream `Instance.para` are used as input | [1]     |               |

**Example**:

Instance.para = "ll/xx/bb"

Instance.content = 123

If configured as

```json
{
    "plain":true,
    "part":[1]
}
```

After executed, Instance.content becomes: ["xx",123]

If configured as

```json
{
"part":[0,2]
}
```

After executed, Instance.content becomes: ["ll/bb","123"], note that 123 is double quoted

### time_range

**Function**: Used to generate a time range (unit: seconds) and assign it to the `Instance.para` property.

**Option**:

| Option    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example   | Default Value |

| value     | If the `unit` value is "s","m","h","d", then `value` is the number of intervals (must be> 0)<br />If the unit value is "w","M ","y" then `value` is the offset; value can be <0, which means offset from the tail to the front. The range of values are as follows:<br />week: [-7, 6]<br /> month: [-20, 19]<br /> year: [-200, 199] | 5         | 1             |
